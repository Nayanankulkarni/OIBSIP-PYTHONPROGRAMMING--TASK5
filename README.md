 Developed an advanced chat application with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Tkinter, PyQt, or a web framework. Add features like user authentication, multiple chat rooms, multimedia sharing (images, videos), message history, notifications, emojis, and encryption for data security.
 
Objective – To build a secure one-to-one chat application with encryption, login, and message storage.

Step 1 – Start the program as either a server or client.

Step 2 – Server listens for client connections and manages user sessions.

Step 3 – Client logs in with username/password (stored in SQLite DB).

Step 4 – Messages are encrypted using Fernet before transmission.

Step 5 – Clients can send/receive text and image messages in real time.

Step 6 – Chat history is stored in a SQLite database for persistence.

Tools Used – Python, Tkinter (GUI), Socket & Threading (networking), SQLite, Cryptography (Fernet), PIL (images).

Steps Performed – User authentication, encryption, message sending/receiving, and UI updates.

Outcome – A secure chat app enabling encrypted communication with a user-friendly GUI.
